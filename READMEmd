# HBZ Earth - Server Rules

Welcome to **HBZ Earth**, a geopolitical Minecraft Earth server. These rules ensure fair play, historical immersion, and a respectful community.

---

## 🔴 Global Punishment Policy

**Unless otherwise specified**, rule-breaking follows the **3-2-1 system**:

- ✅ **2 Warnings**  
- 🚫 **1 Temporary Mutes/Bans (short term)**  
- ❌ **1 Final Strike = Permanent Ban**

> Some violations (e.g. cheating, exploiting, doxxing, sexual misconduct) may skip this system and result in **immediate permanent bans**.

---

## 1. Cheating, Exploits, and Alternative Accounts

### 1.1 Unauthorized Modifications & Cheat Clients
Using cheat clients, macros, or mods that provide gameplay advantages is strictly prohibited.

**Punishment:** Immediate permanent ban.

**Allowed Mods:**
- OptiFine, performance enhancers.
- HUD mods (armor, potion effects).
- Minimap mods (if not more detailed than HBZ map).
- Cosmetic mods (e.g. shaders).
- Litematica (printer function must be **off**).

> Unsure? Ask staff before using any mod.

---

### 1.2 Assisting Rulebreakers
If you knowingly help someone break the rules, you will be punished the same as if you did it yourself.

---

### 1.3 Exploiting Bugs
Exploiting glitches or bugs without reporting them is a serious offense.

**Punishment:** Permanent ban.

---

### 1.4 Alternative Accounts
Only **one** account per player.

- 1st Offense: Alt banned, main warned.
- 2nd Offense: All accounts permanently banned.

> You may share a network with others, but only if each person plays their own account. You might be required to prove they are owned by different people.

---

### 1.5 Intentional Disruption
Purposely lagging the server, crashing it, or attacking services will lead to a permanent ban.

---

## 2. Player Behavior and Chat

### 2.1 Naming Policy
**Nation Names Must:**
- Be real (historical or modern).
- Reflect actual geography.
- Correspond to their location on the map.

**Town Names / Usernames Must Not:**
- Be sexual, offensive, or inappropriate.
- Be used to impersonate other towns or players.
- Contain advertising.
---

### 2.2 Warfare and Looting

**⚔️ HBZ Earth is a war server — conflict is expected.**

Warfare, conquest, and territorial disputes are central to HBZ Earth gameplay. Looting and destruction are considered legitimate acts of war, not griefing or rule-breaking — provided they are done within the game's mechanics and without the use of prohibited modifications.

**What is allowed:**
- Looting enemy bases, towns, and nations during or after wartime.
- Using tactics such as siege warfare, sabotage, blockades, or military deception.
- Taking resources, equipment, or valuables from defeated enemies.
- Organizing coordinated military strikes and planned invasions.

> ⚠️ **War has consequences.** If you don’t want to be looted, prepare for war, fortify, and make allies.

**Not allowed:**
- Using cheats (e.g., x-ray) to locate hidden locations.
- Exploiting glitches or bypassing protection systems.
- Claim abuse to grief rather than conquer (see 3.3).

> Warfare must have purpose — political, strategic, or territorial. Random destruction for its own sake may be punished as **toxic behavior** or **griefing**.

**TL;DR:**
- Raiding = War Looting.
- Stealing = Spoils of Conquest.
- Protect your capital, stockpile, and borders.
- Don’t whine if you lost a war — rebuild or strike back harder.

> **War is not fair. It is just historical.**

---

### 2.3 Chat Spam
Sending repeated or disruptive messages is not allowed.

---

### 2.4 Unwanted or Abusive Behavior

**Zero tolerance. Period.**

HBZ Earth is a server for strategic warfare, nationbuilding, and historical geopolitics — not for harassment, abuse, or manipulation. We take unwanted behavior seriously and enforce strict punishments without warning if necessary. Your actions, both on and off the server (including Discord, DMs, and social platforms), are subject to these rules when they affect the HBZ Earth community.

The following behaviors are **strictly prohibited**:

- **Bullying or harassment** of any kind — such as targeted insults, name-calling, public shaming, or harassment campaigns — is not allowed **outside the context of a geopolitical mindset**.

> 🏛️ **In-game political conflict is allowed.**
- Propaganda, insults, or satire against enemy nations, factions, or leaders — *within reason* — is part of HBZ Earth gameplay.
- Calling an enemy ruler a "tyrant" or "coward" in character is fine.
- Publishing fake "newspapers," manifestos, or war propaganda is encouraged.
- In-game trash talk between nations, soldiers, or rivals is acceptable **as long as it doesn't cross into personal attacks.**

**Bottom line:** If you’re attacking the *character*, that’s politics.  
If you’re attacking the *person behind the screen*, that’s harassment.- **Hate speech**, including slurs, stereotypes, or threats against race, nationality, religion, gender, sexuality, or disability.
- **Racism, homophobia, transphobia, or anti-LGBTQ+ comments** — including subtle microaggressions or “jokes.” There is **no room** for this on HBZ Earth.
- **Encouraging suicide, self-harm, or real-world violence** — even “as a joke.”
- **Sexual content or advances** — of any kind, whether **explicit, suggestive, flirtatious, or "just joking"** — are strictly prohibited. This includes private messages, Discord chats, roleplay, or any interaction on or off the server that involves HBZ Earth players.

- **Grooming, coercion, or manipulative behavior**, especially toward minors, is one of the most serious offenses possible on this server. We will not tolerate it — **at all**.

> 🛡️ HBZ Earth staff are **extremely cautious and proactive** about identifying and stopping predatory behavior. If we detect it, we will act swiftly — and in extreme cases, go beyond in-game bans.

**What counts as grooming/coercion:**
- Requesting or pressuring others (especially minors) for:
  - Personal information (e.g., age, name, location, school, phone number)
  - Voice calls or video chats
  - Selfies or other photos
- Trying to create "special bonds" with younger players or vulnerable individuals as a means to gain trust.
- Inappropriate conversations about bodies, sex, relationships, or "mature themes" with minors.
- Flirting, lovebombing, or emotionally manipulating others — particularly those who are underage or insecure.
- Claiming "it was a joke," "we were RPing," or "they were okay with it" is **never a defense**.

> 🔒 **This is not just a rule — it’s a line we do not allow anyone to cross.**

---

### 🛑 Real-World Escalation
If staff determine that a player has engaged in **grooming, sexual harassment, or exploitation**, especially of minors:
- We will **permanently ban** the player with no warning.
- We may **report the incident to external platforms** (such as Discord Trust & Safety or Mojang/Microsoft).
- If the behavior is severe and involves real-world risk or criminal activity, we **reserve the right to report it to the appropriate legal authorities.**

We do this not to be harsh — but because **we will always put the safety of our community above all else.** The moment you endanger another player, your rights on HBZ Earth end.

---

> ⚠️ **This rule applies regardless of the ages involved.**
- If both players are minors, this rule still applies.
- If the behavior is mutual but inappropriate, both may be penalized — especially if it puts others at risk or sets a bad example.
- If you're unsure whether a conversation or action is inappropriate, it probably is. Stop.

---

**HBZ Earth is not your dating app.**  
**This is a game of nations and war — not a place for sexual, romantic, or emotionally manipulative interactions.**

---

- **Gaslighting, threats, doxxing, or blackmail** — any attempt to control or harm a player mentally, emotionally, or socially.
- **Malicious trolling** that crosses the line into mental or emotional abuse.
- **Weaponizing real-life trauma** or sensitive identity topics in arguments or RP.

> 🛑 **We will not tolerate the use of HBZ Earth as a place to groom, exploit, or harass others — especially minors or vulnerable players.** Staff are authorized to investigate and ban immediately with or without warning, including via Discord reports or server logs.

---

### 2.5 Impersonation
Do not impersonate other players or towns via nicknames, titles, skins, or town/nation names.

---

### 2.6 Personal Information
Do **not** share anyone's private information (photos, addresses, IPs, names, etc.) without explicit permission.

> Leaking or threatening to leak personal info = **immediate ban**.

---

### 2.7 Links
**Not Allowed:**
- Malicious links (e.g. IP grabbers, viruses).
- NSFW/violent content.
- Anything breaking other rules.

---

### 2.8 Advertising
Advertising unrelated servers, Discords, or services is forbidden.

---

### 2.9 Real Money Trading (RMT)

**Buying or selling in-game items, currency, services, or accounts for real-world money outside the official HBZ Earth Store is strictly prohibited.**

This includes:
- Selling items, currency (gold, gear, etc.), towns, or nation claims for real money, crypto, or gift cards.
- Offering in-game services like building, fighting, or raiding in exchange for real money.
- Paying someone for advantages, favors, or land ownership in-game.
- Buying or selling Minecraft accounts.

> 💸 **If you engage in RMT — whether you’re buying or selling — you will be permanently banned.**  
Both buyer and seller will be punished. There are **no warnings** and no exceptions.

---

#### ❌ If you lost money, that’s on you.

- HBZ Earth **will not help you recover money**, accounts, or items.
- You **broke the rules and took the risk** — we are not responsible for any scam, lost payment, or broken deal.
- We will not unban you even if you claim it was a “misunderstanding.”

> ⚠️ If someone offers you an RMT deal, **report it immediately**. Do not participate.

---

### ✅ Buying from the HBZ Earth Store is allowed!

**You are absolutely allowed to make real money purchases from the official HBZ Earth web store.**

There you can safely and legally purchase:
- Ranks
- Cosmetic items
- Crate keys or donation rewards
- Other perks approved by the server team

**Buying from the store supports the server and is fully safe and secure.**  
Only purchases made through the **official HBZ store** are allowed — anything else is bannable.

---

**TL;DR:**  
**Player-to-player real money trades = Permanent ban**  
**HBZ Earth Store = Safe and approved**

---

### 2.10 Language in Global Chat
Use **English** in global chat. You may use other languages in private chats.

---

### 3.1 Griefing in Claims

**HBZ Earth is a war server — destruction is part of the game.**  
However, there's a difference between strategic conquest and mindless griefing.

---

#### ✅ Allowed (Strategic Destruction):

- Destroying or looting claimed areas during **active wars, sieges, or invasions**.
- Betraying or sabotaging your own town/faction from within (you trusted them — your fault).
- Using **scorched earth tactics**: lava, TNT, obsidian, etc., with a **clear symbolic or military purpose. However this does not mean you can "Lava Cast"**.
- **Claiming enemy land during conquest** to push borders or enforce a peace deal.
- **Internal sabotage** from insiders (trusted players), including trap placement or item theft.
- **Propaganda or symbolic ruin**: destroying statues, burning flags, or dismantling monuments.

> 🧨 This is a historical war sim. War is messy — protect yourself accordingly.

---

#### ❌ Not Allowed (Toxic Griefing or Abuse):
- Excessive terrain destruction meant purely to make land unplayable (lava oceans, obsidian pits, etc.).

---

### 🔒 Claim Arming / Claim Blocking

**Claim Arming** — also known as **Claim Blocking** — is the act of placing towns or claims **solely to obstruct or trap another town or nation** from expanding, escaping, or functioning.

**This is generally not allowed.**

Claiming land to gain a tactical edge or apply geopolitical pressure is part of the game.  
But **completely walling off** another group, denying them all movement or expansion, especially without the intention to engage, build, or occupy, is considered **toxic gameplay** and **staff may intervene**.

---

#### ❌ Not Allowed (Claim Arming):

- Creating a “buffer town” whose **only purpose** is to stop another town from expanding.
- Surrounding a nation’s border with **empty or inactive** towns to trap them in.
- Claiming near a town with **no RP, military, or infrastructure usage**.
- Using **alts, shell towns, or ghost claims** to box someone in without intent to engage.

> 🛑 You **cannot fully restrict** another town/nation’s movement or block access to the map unless it is part of a siege, war, or legitimate conquest.

---

#### ✅ Allowed (Geopolitical Conquest):

You **can** claim aggressively or up to someone else’s borders if:

- You are in a **cold war, active war, or ongoing RP tension**.
- You intend to **siege, conquer, or pressure** the town with a real geopolitical or RP goal.
- The claims have **functional use**: forts, trenches, roads, watchtowers, etc.
- You’re building **strategic infrastructure** or preparing for conflict — not just walling them in.
- There are **reasonable escape routes** or diplomatic options remaining.

> 🧠 **Staff will use discretion** to determine if your claim strategy is legitimate or abusive.  
> 🚩 If your towns are just empty boxes meant to frustrate or cage others, they will be removed.

---

### ⚠️ STAFF DISCRETION & GREY AREAS

Claiming near others is not inherently rule-breaking — **Earth is a geopolitical sandbox**.  
However, if your actions are clearly **meant to harass, trap, or shut down another group’s play** without purpose or RP motivation, staff may remove your claims and issue warnings or bans.

If you're unsure, **open a ticket** before placing “pressure claims” in a contested area.

---

### 🧱 TRUST = RESPONSIBILITY

If someone you trusted griefs your land from inside (with perms), this is **not staff’s problem**.

> 🔑 Trust is a political decision.  
> 💣 Betrayal is part of war.  
> 🧠 Be careful who you let in.

---

### 3.3 Claim Abuse

Using the claim system to troll, trap, or ruin others' experiences is not allowed.

**Examples:**
- Claiming directly outside another town just to box them in (unless it’s a siege).
- Spammy claims used to troll others.

**Staff may remove claims** that serve no strategic purpose. No refunds.

---

### 🌍 3.4 World Destruction

HBZ Earth is a geopolitical sandbox — **not an anarchy wasteland**.  
Players are expected to **respect the realism** of the Earth map, even during conflict or expansion.

---

#### ❌ Not Allowed:

- **Deforming real-world geography**, such as:
  - Creating **unnatural landmasses** like artificial islands, skylands, or void pits.
  - Destroying continents, draining oceans, or terraforming entire regions unnaturally.
- **Littering the world** with immersion-breaking junk:
  - Floating trees, scattered block spam, glitched chunk holes.
  - Giant cobble or dirt structures with no purpose.
- Building **massive "meme" or trash builds** near spawn, capital cities, trade hubs, etc.
- Digging enormous quarries or strip mines on the **surface** that leave scars in visible areas.

> 🚫 **The Earth map is not a blank canvas for grief builds or garbage terraforming.**

---

#### ✅ Allowed With Purpose:

- Digging trenches, tunnels, or walls for **military defense** or RP use.
- Making **realistic terraforming** for towns, cities, or farmland.
- Building visible infrastructure: **canals, ports, bridges, dams**, etc.

---

### 🧠 General Rule:

**If it looks like a build a real nation might make — you're fine.**  
**If it looks like someone had a stroke in creative mode — it’s going to be removed.**

Please mine, terraform, and wage war **responsibly**. You live on Earth — don’t trash it.

---

### 3.5 Map Art

Players are free to create map art **only within your own claims** on HBZ Earth.

---

#### Allowed:
- Any style or size of map art inside your own town or nation claims.

---

#### Not Allowed:

- Creating map art outside your own claim or inside someone else’s claim without permission.
- Forcing other players to view map art they may find offensive (e.g., placing it in highly trafficked or shared spaces).
- Absurd, disruptive, or excessively large map art that negatively impacts gameplay or server performance.
- Offensive content aimed at harassing or targeting individuals or groups (hate symbols, slurs, etc.).

---

> Staff reserve the right to remove map art that violates these rules or disrupts gameplay or server performance without warning or refunds.

> Players should report extreme or claim-intrustive map art to staff immediately.

## 4. Staff and Rule Interpretation

### 4.1 Staff Word is Final
Staff may act to protect the server or its players, even outside written rules.

---

### 4.2 False Reporting
Faking reports or weaponizing rules is a punishable offense.

---

### 4.3 Ban Appeals
Appeals are allowed, but not guaranteed. Rudeness or dishonesty hurts your case. Also, don't pester a staff member to look at your appeal, we will look when we have time.

---

## 5. Final Notes

### HBZ Earth is a Historical War Sandbox

- Expect conflict, betrayal, and diplomacy.
- Some nations will fall, others will rise.
- Roleplay, scheme, and strategize — but don’t take it personally.

---

**Don’t Be a Creep, a Cheat, or a Crybaby**

- Use your brain, be cool, and fight with honor.
- If you want to build a legacy — make one worth remembering.
- If you want to start drama — make it political, not personal.
- If you’re here to manipulate or abuse others — **you won’t last long.**
