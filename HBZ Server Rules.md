# HBZ Earth - Server Rules

Welcome to **HBZ Earth**, a geopolitical Minecraft Earth server. These rules ensure fair play, historical immersion, and a respectful community.

---

## 🔴 Global Punishment Policy

<span id="punishment-system"></span>

**Unless otherwise specified**, rule-breaking follows the **3-2-1 system**:

- ✅ **2 Warnings**  
- 🚫 **1 Temporary Mutes/Bans (short term)**  
- ❌ **1 Final Strike = Permanent Ban**

> Some violations (e.g. cheating, exploiting, doxxing, sexual misconduct) may skip this system and result in **immediate permanent bans**.

---

## 1. Cheating, Exploits, and Alternative Accounts

### 1.1 Unauthorized Modifications & Cheat Clients
Using cheat clients, macros, or mods that provide gameplay advantages is strictly prohibited.

**Punishment:** Immediate permanent ban.

**Allowed Mods:**
- OptiFine, performance enhancers.
- HUD mods (armor, potion effects).
- Minimap mods (if not more detailed than HBZ map).
- Cosmetic mods (e.g. shaders).
- Litematica (printer function must be **off**).

> Unsure? Ask staff before using any mod.

---

### 1.2 Assisting Rulebreakers

If you knowingly assist someone in breaking the rules, you will be held equally responsible and face the same consequences as the person committing the violation. 

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Helping someone plan or execute a rule-breaking action.
- Encouraging or instructing others on how to bypass rules or systems.
- Turning a blind eye while knowingly providing support (e.g. covering for them, providing tools or access).

Intent matters: if it is clear that you were aware of the violation and chose to help or facilitate it, you will be treated as a co-offender.

**Example**: If a user is banned and you share your account with them to help them evade that ban, both you and the banned user will face disciplinary action.

Always act with integrity and report any rule violations instead of aiding them.

---

### 1.3 Exploiting Bugs
Taking advantage of glitches, exploits, or unintended behaviors in the system—without immediately reporting them—is considered a serious offense.

This includes:
- Gaining unfair advantages through bugs (e.g., duplicating items, bypassing restrictions, breaking mechanics).
- Sharing or distributing methods to exploit bugs.
- Knowingly remaining silent about a bug you are using or have discovered.

Whether the exploit seems minor or game-breaking, using it instead of reporting it demonstrates malicious intent and harms the integrity of the platform or game.

**Note:** If you discover a bug, report it through the proper channels immediately. Responsible disclosure is always encouraged and appreciated.

---

### 1.4 Alternative Accounts
Each player is only allowed to have **one** account. Creating or using additional accounts (also known as "alts") for any reason—whether to avoid cooldowns, bypass punishments, gain extra rewards, or manipulate stats—is strictly prohibited.

**Punishments:**
- **1st Offense:** The alternate account will be permanently banned. Your main account will receive a warning.
- **2nd Offense:** All associated accounts, including your main, will be permanently banned with no appeal.

> **Note on Shared Networks:**  
> You are allowed to share a network (e.g., household, school, library) with other players, but each person must play on their own account and follow all rules independently.  
> If multiple accounts are detected on the same network, you may be required to provide proof that they are owned by different individuals (such as voice verification, video call, or other forms of identity validation).

Attempting to circumvent this rule in any way—including pretending multiple people are using the same networked account—is treated as abuse and will result in bans.

---

### 1.5 Intentional Disruption

Deliberately disrupting the performance or stability of the server or its services is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Causing intentional server lag (e.g., through item spam, repeated commands, or resource-heavy exploits).
- Attempting to crash the server or interfere with game performance.
- Glitch abuse that leads to service instability or unplayable conditions for others.

If your actions negatively affect the experience of other players or put unnecessary strain on the system, you will be punished accordingly—even if no permanent damage is done.

**Punishment:** [Follows the standard **3-2-1 system**](#punishment-system)


> However, if your actions involve **external attacks** (e.g., DDoS, brute-forcing, server intrusion attempts), these escalate beyond the normal system and will result in an **instant permanent ban**, with possible reporting to relevant authorities.

We expect all players to act in good faith and respect the shared environment. If you discover something that could be abused, report it—don't use it.

---

## 2. Player Behavior and Chat

### 2.1 Naming Policy
**Nation Names Must:**
- Be real (historical or modern).
- Reflect actual geography.
- Correspond to their location on the map.

**Town Names / Usernames Must Not:**
- Be sexual, offensive, or inappropriate.
- Be used to impersonate other towns or players.
- Contain advertising.
---

### 2.2 Warfare and Looting

**⚔️ HBZ Earth is a war server — conflict is expected.**

Warfare, conquest, and territorial disputes are central to HBZ Earth gameplay. Looting and destruction are considered legitimate acts of war, not griefing or rule-breaking — provided they are done within the game's mechanics and without the use of prohibited modifications.

**What is allowed:**
- Looting enemy bases, towns, and nations during or after wartime.
- Using tactics such as siege warfare, sabotage, blockades, or military deception.
- Taking resources, equipment, or valuables from defeated enemies.
- Organizing coordinated military strikes and planned invasions.

> ⚠️ **War has consequences.** If you don’t want to be looted, prepare for war, fortify, and make allies.

**Not allowed:**
- Using cheats (e.g., x-ray) to locate hidden locations.
- Exploiting glitches or bypassing protection systems.
- Claim abuse to grief rather than conquer (see 3.3).

> Warfare must have purpose — political, strategic, or territorial. Random destruction for its own sake may be punished as **toxic behavior** or **griefing**.

**TL;DR:**
- Raiding = War Looting.
- Stealing = Spoils of Conquest.
- Protect your capital, stockpile, and borders.
- Don’t whine if you lost a war — rebuild or strike back harder.

> **War is not fair. It is just historical.**

---

### 2.3 Chat Spam

Spamming the chat disrupts communication and can make it difficult for others to participate meaningfully. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Repeating the same or similar message multiple times in a short period.
- Excessive use of ALL CAPS, emojis, or nonsensical characters.
- Sending long or meaningless blocks of text (e.g., ASCII art, walls of characters).
- Flooding chat with off-topic or irrelevant messages to derail conversations.
- Using bots, scripts, or macros to automate chat spam.

This rule applies in all text-based channels, including public chat, private messages, and group chats. What may seem funny to you could be disruptive or annoying to others.

> Repeated offenses, intentional disruption, or ignoring warnings will escalate consequences. Use chat responsibly and respectfully.

---

### 2.4 Unwanted or Abusive Behavior

**Zero tolerance. Period.**

HBZ Earth is a server for strategic warfare, nationbuilding, and historical geopolitics — not for harassment, abuse, or manipulation. We take unwanted behavior seriously and enforce strict punishments without warning if necessary. Your actions, both on and off the server (including Discord, DMs, and social platforms), are subject to these rules when they affect the HBZ Earth community.

The following behaviors are **strictly prohibited**:

- **Bullying or harassment** of any kind — such as targeted insults, name-calling, public shaming, or harassment campaigns — is not allowed **outside the context of a geopolitical mindset**.

> 🏛️ **In-game political conflict is allowed.**
- Propaganda, insults, or satire against enemy nations, factions, or leaders — *within reason* — is part of HBZ Earth gameplay.
- Calling an enemy ruler a "tyrant" or "coward" in character is fine.
- Publishing fake "newspapers," manifestos, or war propaganda is encouraged.
- In-game trash talk between nations, soldiers, or rivals is acceptable **as long as it doesn't cross into personal attacks.**

**Bottom line:** If you’re attacking the *character*, that’s politics.  
If you’re attacking the *person behind the screen*, that’s harassment.- **Hate speech**, including slurs, stereotypes, or threats against race, nationality, religion, gender, sexuality, or disability.
- **Racism, homophobia, transphobia, or anti-LGBTQ+ comments** — including subtle microaggressions or “jokes.” There is **no room** for this on HBZ Earth.
- **Encouraging suicide, self-harm, or real-world violence** — even “as a joke.”
- **Sexual content or advances** — of any kind, whether **explicit, suggestive, flirtatious, or "just joking"** — are strictly prohibited. This includes private messages, Discord chats, roleplay, or any interaction on or off the server that involves HBZ Earth players.

- **Grooming, coercion, or manipulative behavior**, especially toward minors, is one of the most serious offenses possible on this server. We will not tolerate it — **at all**.

> 🛡️ HBZ Earth staff are **extremely cautious and proactive** about identifying and stopping predatory behavior. If we detect it, we will act swiftly — and in extreme cases, go beyond in-game bans.

**What counts as grooming/coercion:**
- Requesting or pressuring others (especially minors) for:
  - Personal information (e.g., age, name, location, school, phone number)
  - Voice calls or video chats
  - Selfies or other photos
- Trying to create "special bonds" with younger players or vulnerable individuals as a means to gain trust.
- Inappropriate conversations about bodies, sex, relationships, or "mature themes" with minors.
- Flirting, lovebombing, or emotionally manipulating others — particularly those who are underage or insecure.
- Claiming "it was a joke," "we were RPing," or "they were okay with it" is **never a defense**.

> 🔒 **This is not just a rule — it’s a line we do not allow anyone to cross.**

---

### 🛑 Real-World Escalation
If staff determine that a player has engaged in **grooming, sexual harassment, or exploitation**, especially of minors:
- We will **permanently ban** the player with no warning.
- We may **report the incident to external platforms** (such as Discord Trust & Safety or Mojang/Microsoft).
- If the behavior is severe and involves real-world risk or criminal activity, we **reserve the right to report it to the appropriate legal authorities.**

We do this not to be harsh — but because **we will always put the safety of our community above all else.** The moment you endanger another player, your rights on HBZ Earth end.

---

> ⚠️ **This rule applies regardless of the ages involved.**
- If both players are minors, this rule still applies.
- If the behavior is mutual but inappropriate, both may be penalized — especially if it puts others at risk or sets a bad example.
- If you're unsure whether a conversation or action is inappropriate, it probably is. Stop.

---

**HBZ Earth is not your dating app.**  
**This is a game of nations and war — not a place for sexual, romantic, or emotionally manipulative interactions.**

---

- **Gaslighting, threats, doxxing, or blackmail** — any attempt to control or harm a player mentally, emotionally, or socially.
- **Malicious trolling** that crosses the line into mental or emotional abuse.
- **Weaponizing real-life trauma** or sensitive identity topics in arguments.

> 🛑 **We will not tolerate the use of HBZ Earth as a place to groom, exploit, or harass others — especially minors or vulnerable players.** Staff are authorized to investigate and ban immediately with or without warning, including via Discord reports or server logs.

---

### 2.5 Impersonation

Impersonating other players, staff, towns, or nations is strictly prohibited. This includes any attempt to deceive others into believing you are someone else, whether for malicious purposes, trolling, or personal gain.

Examples of impersonation include:
- Using nicknames, usernames, or display names that mimic another player.
- Copying another player’s skin, title, or formatting to create confusion.
- Naming your town or nation to resemble an existing one with the intent to mislead.
- Claiming to be staff or a specific player, either explicitly or implicitly.
- Faking messages (e.g., using Unicode tricks, special characters, or impersonation bots).

Impersonation undermines trust and can easily lead to scams, miscommunication, and drama. Even if done “as a joke,” it will still be treated as a serious offense.

> If your intention is unclear but your identity causes confusion, you may still be warned or punished. When in doubt—don’t copy others.

---

### 2.6 Personal Information

Sharing or threatening to share another person’s private or personally identifiable information (PII) without their **explicit consent** is strictly forbidden. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Real names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers.
- IP addresses or device information.
- Photos, videos, or recordings of someone without their permission.
- Screenshots of private messages, DMs, or personal conversations.
- Information about someone’s family, location, workplace, or schedule.
- Past aliases or accounts tied to someone’s real identity.

This rule applies **regardless of how the information was obtained**—whether it was posted elsewhere publicly, discovered accidentally, or shared with you in confidence.

> **Leaking or threatening to leak personal info = immediate permanent ban**, with no warnings.  
> This includes doxxing, blackmail, intimidation, and any similar behavior.

We treat this as a zero-tolerance issue. Everyone has the right to privacy and safety—violating that puts others at real-world risk and will not be tolerated under any circumstances.

---

### 2.7 Links

**Not Allowed:**
- Malicious links, including but not limited to IP grabbers, viruses, malware, phishing sites, or anything intended to harm users or steal information.
- Links to NSFW (Not Safe For Work), violent, or otherwise inappropriate content.
- Links promoting cheating, exploits, hacks, or any content that violates other rules outlined here.
- Spammy or unsolicited advertising links that do not add value to the community.

**Allowed:**
- Links to official or trusted resources related to the game or community (e.g., official forums, guides, patch notes).
- Helpful tutorials, walkthroughs, or fan-made content that complies with the rules.
- Links to social media or streaming platforms when sharing your own content, provided it is appropriate and not spammed.
- URLs shortened with reputable services, but only when necessary and without intent to disguise malicious content.

> All links should be shared responsibly. Posting suspicious or excessive links may result in warnings or temporary restrictions. When in doubt, ask a moderator before sharing unusual links.

> If you receive a suspicious link, do not click it and report it immediately.

---

### 2.8 Advertising

Advertising or promoting servers, Discord communities, websites, or services that are **unrelated** to this community is strictly forbidden. This includes:

- Posting invites to unrelated game servers or platforms.
- Sharing links to unrelated Discord servers, social media groups, or forums.
- Promoting third-party products, services, or websites without permission.
- Using chat, private messages, or other communication channels for unsolicited advertising.

**Allowed:**  
Advertising or sharing invites to Discord servers, communities, or resources that are **directly relevant to HBZ Earth**, such as nation or town Discords, official community channels, or related projects, is permitted. However, even these should be shared respectfully and without spamming.

> Advertising related to official community events or with explicit moderator approval may also be allowed.

---

### 2.9 Real Money Trading (RMT)

**Buying or selling in-game items, currency, services, or accounts for real-world money outside the official HBZ Earth Store is strictly prohibited.**

This includes:
- Selling items, currency (gold, gear, etc.), towns, or nation claims for real money, crypto, or gift cards.
- Offering in-game services like building, fighting, or raiding in exchange for real money.
- Paying someone for advantages, favors, or land ownership in-game.
- Buying or selling Minecraft accounts.

> 💸 **If you engage in RMT — whether you’re buying or selling — you will be permanently banned.**  
Both buyer and seller will be punished. There are **no warnings** and no exceptions.

---

#### ❌ If you lost money, that’s on you.

- HBZ Earth **will not help you recover money**, accounts, or items.
- You **broke the rules and took the risk** — we are not responsible for any scam, lost payment, or broken deal.
- We will not unban you even if you claim it was a “misunderstanding.”

> ⚠️ If someone offers you an RMT deal, **report it immediately**. Do not participate.

---

### ✅ Buying from the HBZ Earth Store is allowed!

**You are absolutely allowed to make real money purchases from the official HBZ Earth web store.**

There you can safely and legally purchase:
- Ranks
- Cosmetic items
- Crate keys or donation rewards
- Other perks approved by the server team

**Buying from the store supports the server and is fully safe and secure.**  
Only purchases made through the **official HBZ store** are allowed — anything else is bannable.

---

**TL;DR:**  
**Player-to-player real money trades = Permanent ban**  
**HBZ Earth Store = Safe and approved**

---

### 2.10 Language in Global Chat

To ensure clear communication and inclusivity for all players, **English** must be used in the global chat at all times. This helps moderators effectively monitor conversations and maintain a friendly environment for everyone.

- You are free to use any language in private messages, group chats, or local chats where participants understand each other.
- Excessive use of non-English words, phrases, or slang in global chat that disrupts understanding may be subject to warnings.
- If you want to communicate with speakers of other languages, consider using private channels or community-specific chats dedicated to those languages.

> Respect the diversity of the community while keeping global chat accessible and easy to follow.


---

### 3.1 Griefing in Claims

**HBZ Earth is a war server — destruction is part of the game.**  
However, there's a difference between strategic conquest and mindless griefing.

---

#### ✅ Allowed (Strategic Destruction):

- Destroying or looting claimed areas during **active wars, sieges, or invasions**.
- Betraying or sabotaging your own town/faction from within (you trusted them — your fault).
- Using **scorched earth tactics**: lava, TNT, obsidian, etc., with a **clear symbolic or military purpose. However this does not mean you can "Lava Cast"**.
- **Claiming enemy land during conquest** to push borders or enforce a peace deal.
- **Internal sabotage** from insiders (trusted players), including trap placement or item theft.
- **Propaganda or symbolic ruin**: destroying statues, burning flags, or dismantling monuments.

> 🧨 This is a historical war sim. War is messy — protect yourself accordingly.

---

#### ❌ Not Allowed (Toxic Griefing or Abuse):
- Excessive terrain destruction meant purely to make land unplayable (lava oceans, obsidian pits, etc.).

---

### 🔒 Claim Arming / Claim Blocking

**Claim Arming** — also known as **Claim Blocking** — is the act of placing towns or claims **solely to obstruct or trap another town or nation** from expanding, escaping, or functioning.

**This is generally not allowed.**

Claiming land to gain a tactical edge or apply geopolitical pressure is part of the game.  
But **completely walling off** another group, denying them all movement or expansion, especially without the intention to engage, build, or occupy, is considered **toxic gameplay** and **staff may intervene**.

---

#### ❌ Not Allowed (Claim Arming):

- Creating a “buffer town” whose **only purpose** is to stop another town from expanding.
- Surrounding a nation’s border with **empty or inactive** towns to trap them in.
- Claiming near a town with **no RP, military, or infrastructure usage**.
- Using **alts, shell towns, or ghost claims** to box someone in without intent to engage.

> 🛑 You **cannot fully restrict** another town/nation’s movement or block access to the map unless it is part of a siege, war, or legitimate conquest.

---

#### ✅ Allowed (Geopolitical Conquest):

You **can** claim aggressively or up to someone else’s borders if:

- You are in a **cold war, active war, or ongoing RP tension**.
- You intend to **siege, conquer, or pressure** the town with a real geopolitical or RP goal.
- The claims have **functional use**: forts, trenches, roads, watchtowers, etc.
- You’re building **strategic infrastructure** or preparing for conflict — not just walling them in.
- There are **reasonable escape routes** or diplomatic options remaining.

> 🧠 **Staff will use discretion** to determine if your claim strategy is legitimate or abusive.  
> 🚩 If your towns are just empty boxes meant to frustrate or cage others, they will be removed.

---

### ⚠️ STAFF DISCRETION & GREY AREAS

Claiming near others is not inherently rule-breaking — **Earth is a geopolitical sandbox**.  
However, if your actions are clearly **meant to harass, trap, or shut down another group’s play** without purpose or RP motivation, staff may remove your claims and issue warnings or bans.

If you're unsure, **open a ticket** before placing “pressure claims” in a contested area.

---

### 🧱 TRUST = RESPONSIBILITY

If someone you trusted griefs your land from inside (with perms), this is **not staff’s problem**.

> 🔑 Trust is a political decision.  
> 💣 Betrayal is part of war.  
> 🧠 Be careful who you let in.

---

### 3.3 Claim Abuse

Using the claim system to troll, trap, or ruin others' experiences is not allowed.

**Examples:**
- Claiming directly outside another town just to box them in (unless it’s a siege).
- Spammy claims used to troll others.

**Staff may remove claims** that serve no strategic purpose. No refunds.

---

### 🌍 3.4 World Destruction

HBZ Earth is a geopolitical sandbox — **not an anarchy wasteland**.  
Players are expected to **respect the realism** of the Earth map, even during conflict or expansion.

---

#### ❌ Not Allowed:

- **Deforming real-world geography**, such as:
  - Creating **unnatural landmasses** like artificial islands, skylands, or void pits.
  - Destroying continents, draining oceans, or terraforming entire regions unnaturally.
- **Littering the world** with immersion-breaking junk:
  - Floating trees, scattered block spam, glitched chunk holes.
  - Giant cobble or dirt structures with no purpose.
- Building **massive "meme" or trash builds** near spawn, capital cities, trade hubs, etc.
- Digging enormous quarries or strip mines on the **surface** that leave scars in visible areas.

> 🚫 **The Earth map is not a blank canvas for grief builds or garbage terraforming.**

---

#### ✅ Allowed With Purpose:

- Digging trenches, tunnels, or walls for **military defense** or RP use.
- Making **realistic terraforming** for towns, cities, or farmland.
- Building visible infrastructure: **canals, ports, bridges, dams**, etc.

---

### 🧠 General Rule:

**If it looks like a build a real nation might make — you're fine.**  
**If it looks like someone had a stroke in creative mode — it’s going to be removed.**

Please mine, terraform, and wage war **responsibly**. You live on Earth — don’t trash it.

---

### 3.5 Map Art

Players are free to create map art **only within your own claims** on HBZ Earth.

---

#### Allowed:
- Any style or size of map art inside your own town or nation claims.

---

#### Not Allowed:

- Creating map art outside your own claim or inside someone else’s claim without permission.
- Forcing other players to view map art they may find offensive (e.g., placing it in highly trafficked or shared spaces).
- Absurd, disruptive, or excessively large map art that negatively impacts gameplay or server performance.
- Offensive content aimed at harassing or targeting individuals or groups (hate symbols, slurs, etc.).

---

> Staff reserve the right to remove map art that violates these rules or disrupts gameplay or server performance without warning or refunds.

> Players should report extreme or claim-intrustive map art to staff immediately.

## 4. Staff and Rule Interpretation

### 4.1 Staff Word is Final

Staff members are entrusted with maintaining the safety, fairness, and integrity of the server and its community. Their decisions and actions, even if not explicitly detailed in the written rules, are **final and binding**.

- Staff may intervene, moderate, or enforce actions as necessary to protect the server or its players.
- This includes handling situations that fall outside or between the lines of the written rules.
- Players are expected to comply respectfully and promptly with staff decisions.
- Challenging, arguing against, or publicly undermining staff authority is considered disruptive behavior and may itself result in disciplinary action.
- Staff are held to high standards of conduct and accountability; misuse of power should be reported through the proper channels.

> Trust the staff to act in the best interests of the community, even when tough or unpopular decisions are required.

Failure to respect staff authority undermines the community and will be met with consequences.

---

### 4.2 False Reporting

Submitting false reports, complaints, or accusations—whether to harass others, manipulate situations, or weaponize the rules—is strictly prohibited and will be treated as a serious offense.

- This includes knowingly providing incorrect information to moderators or staff.
- Filing baseless or malicious reports to get others punished or to waste staff resources.
- Abusing the reporting system to cause disruption or to evade consequences yourself.
- Using the rules dishonestly to silence, intimidate, or retaliate against other players.

False reporting undermines trust in the moderation system, wastes valuable time, and harms the community.

> Offenders will face disciplinary actions that may escalate quickly due to the intentional abuse involved.

Respect the reporting process and use it responsibly to help maintain a fair and safe environment for everyone.


---

### 4.3 Ban Appeals

Players may submit appeals if they believe their ban was unjust or if they wish to provide new information. However, appeals are **allowed but not guaranteed** to result in a reversal.

- **Be honest and respectful** when submitting your appeal. Rudeness, dishonesty, or attempts to manipulate the process will only weaken your case.
- Provide clear, concise explanations or evidence that support your appeal. Vague or emotional pleas are less effective.
- Do **not** repeatedly message or pester staff members about your appeal. Staff will review appeals in the order received and when they have the time.
- Appeals that show genuine remorse, understanding of the rules, and willingness to improve are more likely to be considered favorably.
- Submitting multiple appeals for the same ban or using alternate accounts to appeal may result in your appeals being ignored or additional penalties.

> The ban appeal process exists to ensure fairness, but it is not a guaranteed “get out of jail free” card. Respect the process and staff discretion.

Remember: The best way to avoid bans is to follow the rules in the first place.

---

## 5. Final Notes

### HBZ Earth is a Historical War Sandbox

- Expect conflict, betrayal, alliances, and diplomacy.  
- Some nations will rise to greatness; others will inevitably fall.  
- Roleplay, scheme, and strategize — but remember, it’s all part of the game.  
- Don’t take things personally; use setbacks as fuel for your next move.

---

### Don’t Be a Creep, a Cheat, or a Crybaby

- Use your brain, stay calm, and fight with honor.  
- If you want to build a legacy — make it one worth remembering, not one built on toxicity.  
- If you want to stir drama, keep it political, strategic, and clever — avoid personal attacks or harassment.  
- If you’re here to manipulate, harass, or abuse others — **you won’t last long.** This community has zero tolerance for toxicity.
